name: The Grove
description: >
  You continue along the path and come across a grove with a field of white, star-like flowers surrounded by tall,
  thin grey trees. The fresh wind gives you a special whiff of the young white flowers, giving you a simple, sweet
  smell. You hear a bit of rustling from the wind blowing, but everything else seems silent.
