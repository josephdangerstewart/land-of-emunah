name: The Desert Gate
description: >
  Behind you is the lively city you once knew. Ahead of you is the dry and lonely wasteland in which
  your journey has already begun. They say that the desert heat is a constant and unbearable force that
  has been the ruin of many explorers. Shall you be counted among them?
