description: >
  Walking along the woodland path, you come across a creature peering through the trees. It looks different
  than anything you have seen before, with glowing yellow eyes and a blue-grey pelt that swims like mist.
  It’s walking directly towards you, eyes staring into yours. Do you keep still or try to run away along the path?

      You keep still as the creature comes toward to you. As you get a closer look at it, you see its eyes
      are friendly, not dangerous. It comes up to you and rolls on its back for belly rubs. You scratch its
      belly, realizing that all along it was just lonely and wanting of a friend.

      You run as fast as you can from the mysterious creature and forward along the path you were already on.
      As you keep your legs moving, you glance behind you to see the creature hanging it’s head low. It
      slowly dragged itself back to the trees. Perhaps it was just lonely...
