  You notice your surroundings getting darker and start to see the sun setting through the
  clearing of the trees above you. It would be too difficult to travel at night so it’s best
  to find a place to sleep now. Along your path, you discover a tree with branches thick
  enough to support you if you were to sleep on them, protected by a heavy foliage of leaves.
  You notice there’s also enough space for you to sleep on the ground, where it may be safer
  to rest without the possibility of falling. Will you sleep in the branches of the trees closer
  to the sky or upon the safety of the ground at your feet?

      You get settled in the cozy branches of the tree and lay your head down to gaze up at
      the sky through the leaves. The air feels fresher up here and the limitless sky appears
      much closer to you than you expected. You notice as the sky turns dark, stars start to
      flicker sequentially and slowly glow into a pattern of light. As you stare upon such beauty
      and steadily drift to sleep, you gain a sense of wonder and safety within the forest...

      You lay down on the sturdy forest ground with no complication and look up among the tall
      trees and distant leaves. The sky is completely obscured by leaves and branches, with few
      enough holes to give you an impression of the time. As the sky gets darker, it’s harder to
      see around you and you are able to fall asleep smoothly. However, you can’t help but think
      that you might have witnessed something wonderful by laying amongst the tree branches...
