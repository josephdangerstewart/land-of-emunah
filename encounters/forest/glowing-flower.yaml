  You come across a beautiful, glowing flower, surrounded by a ring of dancing mushrooms. As you get closer,
  you hear music and notice the mushrooms are singing to the flower, as if in celebration or praise. Do you
  get closer to discover why this mysterious reverie is taking place, or continue along the path out of caution?

      You step closer towards the ring of mushrooms and the flower, close enough to see its golden petals
      unfurling, opening into the air. In its center lies a small child just as bright as the flower itself.
      The mushrooms leap in the air and their song grows more joyous. You just witnessed the birth of a
      flower fairy, a once in a thousand year occurrence. You smile and hum along to the mushrooms’ song
      celebrating this new life.

      You’ll never know what they were singing about, but at least you stayed on the path, right?...
