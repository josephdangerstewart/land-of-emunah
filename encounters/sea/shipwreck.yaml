  With the waves surging so strongly, you fall out of your boat and dive into the depths of the sea!
  As you start to stabilize yourself on the seafloor, you gaze upon a sunken ship immersed in aquatic
  life. It seems mysterious to you. Do you explore it or ignore the ship entirely?

      As you swim closer to the boat to explore it, you see a dark blur of movement. Long, yellow teeth emerge
      from the ship and start gnashing towards you! In panic, you swim to the surface like you should have
      earlier and barely make it to your boat. You look behind you and see that there are no teeth to be found.
      Though you are safe now, you feel utterly exhausted...

    result: >
      You start swimming your way up to the surface and make it up safely to receive plenty of air. It appears
      the waves have calmed down a bit and the sky is clearing up. You board back on your boat without any
      trouble and you are quickly ready to sail. Good thing you are able to travel safely after falling into the sea!
