  As you travel through the salty sea, your throat starts to dry due to the lack of water. Upon the
  horizon, you see a misty vision of a ship approaching yours. It’s difficult to see whether or not
  they are friends or foes. Do you hail the boat?

      You call to the ship approaching you and it steadies its sails to slow down. As it comes close to your
      boat, it drops a bridge, connecting your boat to itself. You suddenly see barrel after barrel rolling
      down the bridge and into your boat. As you get closer to them, you discover that it’s water, just what
      you needed. When you look up to show your gratitude, the ship suddenly vanishes into misty air. Whatever
      just happened, at least you won’t be thirsty!

      In order to not give the ship your attention, you turn your boat enough to avoid interacting with it.
      As the ship passes you, it suddenly disappears into the misty air, vanishing right before your eyes.
      Your throat grows even more dry as time goes on. Perhaps it was trying to get your attention for something...
