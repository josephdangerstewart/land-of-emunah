  The sun is setting its golden rays across the waters and the sky grows darker. You noticed the waves
  calming down a bit as if the sea itself is falling asleep. You realize that it will be best to sleep
  at night, but you wonder where you could sleep. There is an island close by with a shore surrounded by
  rocks that seem to provide a safe space to sleep. However, you also could sleep aboard your boat of
  which you are already familiar. Do you sleep on the shore or on your boat?

      You sail your boat close to the shore and anchor it there. Right as you step off the boat upon the
      sandy rocks, you immediately feel a sense of peace, letting the fresh ocean air brush against
      your face. As you lay down upon the shore, you stare up at the stars and let the crashing of waves
      fill your ears, satisfying your need for comfort and relaxation. You are grateful to have found such
      a peaceful spot to lullaby you to sleep with it’s sounds of water and smells of sweet salt...

      You decide to stay on the boat to sleep. As you lay there, you can’t seem to shake off the idea
      of sleeping upon the shore. There seems to be something about that particular spot that fascinates
      you, but you can't really pinpoint it. You figured it would be safer on your boat, but you also wonder
      if there might have been something you needed upon that shore...
