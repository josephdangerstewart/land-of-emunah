  You look in your water container and discover that there’s no more water in it. You look ahead of you to see if there’s
  anywhere to find more water. All you see is a cactus and some rock formation behind it. You could try to drink the cactus
  juice in order to quench your thirst or just continue on with nothing to drink. Do you try to drink from the cactus?

      Congratulations, you just learned something. You just learned that four out of five cacti are toxic.
      Unfortunately, you aren't very lucky. You feel very weak as you try to continue on. Hopefully you
      won’t die from drinking that...

    choiceText: No, that’s disgusting!

      You don’t drink the cactus, but you still feel very thirsty and wish you had something to drink. As you
      continue to journey on, you come upon a small spring tickling with clean water from a rock formation
      not too far from the cactus. Looks like you didn't need to drink that cactus juice anyways.
