      As you lay down and decide to look up before sleeping, you gaze up into the vast and changing cosmos,
      your eyes journey infinitely through the interconnected systems. You see a balance of space and connectedness,

      You sleep safe and sound, isolated from the dangers of the outside world. Your tent is an armor around you,
      protecting you from the unknown. Though you are able to sleep without consequence or complication, you can't
      help, but feel as though you've missed something...
