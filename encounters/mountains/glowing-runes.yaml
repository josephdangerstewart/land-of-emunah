  The sky starts to get dark as you continue walking along the path. As you struggle to progress through the
  dark, you are suddenly blinded by a bright light that appears on the wall to your left. You catch your
  bearings and discern strange glowing patterns on the wall. Their white light illuminates your path. Do
  you stop to read or continue on?

      You can’t seem to discern much. You keep walking along the runes, but don’t watch the path
      ahead of you in your wonder. You stumbled off a lucky short, three feet ledge, spraining your
      ankle. Perhaps you shouldn’t have gotten distracted.

      The way is lit by the runes. You see a three foot ledge that the dark might have hidden from
      you. You are grateful to have the light to guide your way.
