  As you walk along the rocky path, you come across a pedestal with a red shining
  gemstone the size of your palm sitting centered at the top. The red glow of the
  stone is mesmerizing and you can’t seem to stop looking at it. Do you touch it?

      You grab the stone and it immediately feels ice cold. As you hold it in your
      hand longer and observe the details of the gemstone, you recognize a strange
      shimmer across the bottom of it. As you look closer at it, the gemstone suddenly
      explodes from your grip, causing you to fall back on the rocky gravel road.
      You blink at your hand where the gemstone was and all you see is a bloody carving
      in your palm of a strange symbol you have never seen before. Although, you have
      heard of curses happening in this sort of way before...

    choiceText: No, it could possibly be a trap.
    result: >
      Though you found it difficult to leave the stone away from your sight, you continue on.
      You believe that it’s better to simply leave it alone because it may have been a trap.
      If it wasn’t a trap, you would have never known, but you probably don’t need it
      for this particular journey anyways.
