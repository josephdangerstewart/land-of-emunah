  It is beginning to grow too dark to see along the path and your eyes begin to grow heavy.
  You noticed a strangely quiet cave nearby thatâ€™s big enough to sleep comfortably in. Do you
  sleep in the strangely quiet cave or along the mountainside away from the cave?

      As you lay yourself down within the mouth of the silent cave, you realize how soothing the
      silence and emptiness of the cave is. You turn your head to stare down the hole of the cave,
      letting your eyes adjust to the darkness and wonder upon the nothingness. As your eyes adjust,
      you feel a sense of comfort and security from the rock formation around you. You feel a sense
      of protection from the earth and easiest drift off in your wonder for the mysterious yet
      beautiful place.

      You find a decently comfortable spot to sleep away from the mouth of the cave and lay yourself down.
      You can't help, but feel as if the cave is luring you in or trying to get you to come inside it.
      You roll yourself away from staring at the entrance and just force yourself to sleep. Though you
      are able to sleep without consequence or complication, you wonder what might have happened if you
      just went inside that cave to sleep...
